## ðŸ§ª Data Quality & Testing

We validate business logic with a mix of:

- **Generic tests**: `not_null`, `unique`, `relationships`  
- **Custom SQL tests**:
  - Negative pricing or discounts
  - Stock vs. items ordered inconsistencies
  - Invalid `shipment_status` values
  - Missing or null core metrics

```bash
dbt test
```
